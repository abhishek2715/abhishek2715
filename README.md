### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Graduated from the University of Delhi, studied Data Science and Machine Learning at Jovian. I have a keen interest in the field of the data industry, therefore chose to switch to the technical field all the way from a commerce background. I have explored different domains to be independent during college such as Python, HR, and Content Writing.
